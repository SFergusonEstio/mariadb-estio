     -- Creates another table in your database (give it any name).  
     -- Uses INSERT commands to add a couple of test records.
     -- Then, deletes these test records. 
     -- Then deletes the table itself.






-- Task 7

-- USE Stock;

-- Create a query that for a particular order number, shows the items that have been ordered, the price of each item that is in the database (which include VAT), and the price of each item excluding VAT.  Note that the latter will need to be a calculated field.
-- Write a query that uses a calculated field to display the total amount payable for each product on each order (i.e. the price of each product multiplied by the quantity).  





-- Task 8

-- USE Stock;

-- Create a query that for a particular order number, shows the items that have been ordered, the price of each item that is in the database (which include VAT), and the price of each item excluding VAT.  Note that the latter will need to be a calculated field.
-- Write a query that uses a calculated field to display the total amount payable for each product on each order (i.e. the price of each product multiplied by the quantity).
-- An important customer has rung up. They placed an order (376805), but having received the products, they are not satisfied with the quality or reliability of the items. Using this order number, write a query that finds the item number for this order – and then saves this item number to a variable. You should then PRINT the variable to the screen so that it is visible when the query is executed.
-- Continuing on from the query above:- Because the item in question is an expensive product, and there are serious concerns over the quality of this stock, management have made the decision to temporarily remove this item from sale. Extend the query from above, so that the item number saved to a variable is used in an UPDATE query to modify the items stock level to 0 (zero).  This will ensure that no more of this item can be ordered temporarily.

-- (extension) Write a query that shows the value of stock we hold from each of our suppliers  (display the name of each supplier, and next to it display the total value of stock from that supplier)





-- Task 11

-- USE Stock;

--  Display each category of product that we sell, and the number of orders for each category that we currently have.  However, only display results for categories where the number of orders is less than 20.

-- Create a VIEW that contains: Product descriptions next to the name of the company that supplies them
-- Create a VIEW that contains: A list of order numbers, with the product name and quantity ordered next to it
-- For each of the VIEWs: Run a SELECT query of some sort, to check that the data is retrievable.
